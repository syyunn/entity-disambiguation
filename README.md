# Define
Find f s.t. for any two object s1, s2 \in S , f(s1, s2) = 0 or 1 when 0 A!=B otherwise A=B

## NED under the context of RDBMS
In case we are assuming the conctete situation that peforms NED over RDMBS, the NED have to be performed in two fold - one is inside-table-NED and the other one is betwee-table-NED

### Inside-table-NED (also called "table semantic interpretation systems")

-- "TabEL, which employs a graphical model to jointly model table interpretation. Such joint models are based on a strong assumption that the relations expressed can be mapped to the target KB, if not consider otherwise."
